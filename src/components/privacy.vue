                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                     include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
                      your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                       monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for 
                       recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not 
                       currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking
                         is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice 
                         in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                    <p>
                      Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
                       determine you are the same person about whom we have the information 
                       in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to 
                       provide information so that we can match it with information you have 
                       previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
                        you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we 
                        can match the information you provide with the information we already
                         have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method 
                         (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. 
                         We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify 
                      your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, 
                      we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes 
                      of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the 
                      information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide 
                      additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and 
                      for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
                       provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
                    </p>
